uh let's say features that will help you
to increase the value
of your current xmc install uh and
migrating towards the cloud iq site
engine first of all
as i mentioned the licensing model will
be unified so wired wireless
pi uh the licenses will be unified into
like pilots for any aps or
ceviches or routers that are natively
supported by cloud iq
or navigator for third-party visibility
and later on in the
in the short to medium uh let's say
phases also config even configuration
to third-party equipment will also be
available but
the licensing model will be unified okay
so uh today this might be kind of a
burden or
difficulty for you uh ability to access
your cloud like your site in
engine instance anywhere you are right
so
uh we have plans to have a single
sign-on
from the cloud iq to your site engine
and you can have multiple site engine
deployments
in a distributed environment so you will
be able to
to access those instances anywhere you
are
and of course this brings up another
item
which is manager of managers so imagine
that you have multiple cloud iq
site engines and you would like to have
a centralized view
cloud iq will be that centralized view
and will synthesize
gather all the information from multiple
different cloud
site engine instances and of course
cloud speed which we already have with
the cloud iq
thanks to the fourth generation and
microservices architecture
so we are already getting this new
features and updates in cloud iq
but now since uh we will be sending the
data
from site engine to cloud iq that data
will that the variety of data
will increase with cloud speed
and unlimited number of site engine
instances that's another item
so normally today if you have nms base
or nms
licenses you just have right to install
only one instance of the extreme
management center
if you have an ms advanced you have
three one the main install
one the backup and one only for lab
purposes
so three so but with the with the site
engine
basically you have unlimited number of
instances that you can install okay
and uh again so this is really important
nms base if you are using nms base or
lms licensing
you will automatically get nms advanced
functionality without any additional
cost
and the last but not the least is the
unlimited data retention
currently we have this let's say
data durable data availability which is
unlimited in cloud iq
and of course since ex since cloud iq
site engine will be sending the data to
cloud iq
this means you will also have unlimited
data retention for
the devices that that are managed by uh
cloud iq site
so this is huge because this this is
basically
you will never be able to have we will
never be able to have this functionality
without
just on-prem solution with no connection
to the to the cloud
